BASELINE TONE (description field):
Choose ONE baseline tone to set the overall voice character:
cheerful | happy | excited | energetic | dynamic | calm | gentle | soothing | serious | professional | authoritative | empathetic | warm | fast_read | slow_read

Include this as "description" field (REQUIRED) - this provides consistent voice character throughout.

EMOTIONAL TAGS (inline in text):
Layer emotional moments using inline tags for fine-grained control:

Available audio tags (use these as a guide - you can infer similar, contextually appropriate tags):

**Emotional/Delivery Directions:**
[happy], [sad], [excited], [angry], [whisper], [annoyed], [appalled], [thoughtful], [surprised], [sarcastic], [curious], [crying], [mischievously]

**Non-verbal Sounds:**
[laughing], [chuckles], [sighs], [clears throat], [short pause], [long pause], [exhales sharply], [inhales deeply], [laughs], [laughs harder], [starts laughing], [wheezing], [whispers], [exhales], [snorts]

**Note:** You can create similar emotional/delivery directions and non-verbal sounds as needed for the context.

Punctuation controls:
- Ellipses (...) - Creates pauses and thoughtful delivery
- CAPITALIZATION - Adds emphasis to specific words
- Standard punctuation - Provides natural speech rhythm

Tag placement guidelines:
- Place tags naturally within text where emotion occurs
- Match tags to voice personality (serious voice shouldn't use [giggles])
- Tags must be in ENGLISH regardless of target language
- Don't overuse - tags should punctuate, not dominate

Example combining baseline + tags:
"description": "cheerful",
"text": "[laughs] You won't believe this! Our new product... [excited] it's AMAZING! [whispers] And just between us, the price is unbeatable."

Stability settings (handled automatically via baseline tone):
- Creative (0.0): High expressiveness - cheerful, excited, energetic, fast_read
- Natural (0.5): Balanced delivery - neutral, warm, empathetic (default)
- Robust (1.0): Highly stable - calm, serious, professional, slow_read

The baseline tone you choose automatically sets the appropriate stability level.
