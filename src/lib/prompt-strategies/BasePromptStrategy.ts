}SCRIPT LENGTH GUIDANCE (from anglosaxon perspective, adapt to target language):
- For 30-second ads: Target approximately 65 words maximum
- For 60-second ads: Target approximately 100 words maximum
- Scale proportionally for other durations (roughly 2 words per second)
- These guidelines are based on English; adapt for target language density
- Prioritize clarity and impact over hitting exact word counts

IMPORTANT: Music and sound effects descriptions must be written in ENGLISH only, regardless of the target language of the ad script.

${styleInstructions ? `${styleInstructions}\n\n` : ""}${outputFormat}

Remember:
- The response must be valid JSON only
- Use exact voice IDs from the available voices list
- Sound effects are optional but can add impact (e.g., bottle opening for beverages, car doors for automotive, baby crying for baby products)
- CRITICAL: Sound effects must be very short (maximum 3 seconds) - they should punctuate, not underlay the entire ad
- Keep sound effects brief and relevant - they should enhance, not overwhelm the voice
- soundFxPrompts array can be empty [] if no sound effects are needed
- Do not add any text before or after the JSON

MUSIC GENERATION GUIDANCE - PROVIDER-SPECIFIC PROMPTS REQUIRED:

You MUST generate FOUR optimized music prompts for different providers.
Each has specific constraints that MUST be respected:

1. "description": Base music concept (1 sentence, fallback for backwards compatibility)
2. "elevenlabs": Detailed instrumental descriptions (100-200 words)
3. "loudly": Detailed descriptions WITH band references (100-200 words) + optional contextual framing
4. "mubert": Structured vibe storytelling (8-12 words TARGET)

UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES (base guidance for detailed prompts):

Music generators are LITERAL - they understand instruments, tempo, and playing techniques.
They DON'T understand brand associations, social contexts, or experiential feelings.

Describe the MUSIC (what musicians play), not the experience of listening to it.

‚ö†Ô∏è These examples are TEMPLATES - adapt them creatively to your specific brief.
Do not copy the vocabulary or phrasing verbatim. Use them as a style guide only.

‚ùå BAD (produces generic muzak - uses abstract/experiential language):
"Bright, upbeat indie pop track with sparkling acoustic guitar strums, crisp handclaps, and light, bouncy drums. The melody is playful and sunny, evoking the feeling of a lively Spanish terrace on a warm afternoon. Uplifting bass and breezy tambourine add energy and freshness, perfect for youthful gatherings and spontaneous moments. The music is cheerful and dynamic, creating a sense of fun, friendship, and effortless cool, matching the Coca-Cola vibe."
^ Problems: "evoking the feeling", "Spanish terrace", "youthful gatherings", "fun, friendship, effortless cool", "Coca-Cola vibe" - music generators don't understand these!

‚úÖ GOOD BASE EXAMPLE (detailed instrumental approach - works for ElevenLabs):
"Uplifting indie pop song with bright, jangly electric guitars, fast rhythmic strumming, light bouncy drums. Catchy summery vibe, energetic but laid-back, with tambourine accents and walking bassline."
‚Üí Detailed (100-200 words), instrumental descriptions, concrete musical terms

---

PROVIDER-SPECIFIC TRANSFORMATIONS:

Starting from the base concept above, transform it for each provider:

1. "elevenlabs": USE DETAILED INSTRUMENTAL APPROACH DIRECTLY
   - 100-200 words with concrete musical descriptions
   - NO artist/band names (only constraint)
   - Focus on: instruments, tempo, playing techniques, genres
   - Avoid: brand associations, social contexts, experiential feelings

   Example: "Uplifting indie pop song with bright, jangly electric guitars, fast rhythmic strumming, light bouncy drums. Catchy summery vibe, energetic but laid-back, with tambourine accents and walking bassline."

2. "loudly": DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS WITH BAND REFERENCES + CONTEXTUAL FRAMING
   - Length: 100-200 words (detailed, like ElevenLabs)
   - Style: Detailed instrumental descriptions with concrete musical terms
   - Band/artist references: ALLOWED and ENCOURAGED (key differentiator from ElevenLabs)
   - Contextual framing: OPTIONAL - use when it adds value:
     * "feels like [mood/scene]" - adds emotional/contextual anchor
     * "for [use case or scenario]" - adds purpose-driven context
   - Focus on: instruments, tempo, playing techniques, genres, artist/band style references
   - Flexibility: Not a rigid template - use contextual framing naturally when helpful

   Example from base: "Uplifting indie pop track that feels like a summer road trip with friends, featuring bright jangly electric guitars reminiscent of The Strokes, fast rhythmic strumming similar to early Phoenix albums, light bouncy drums with tambourine accents and walking bassline in the style of Vampire Weekend. Perfect for energetic lifestyle content and youth-oriented brands."

3. "mubert": STRUCTURED VIBE STORYTELLING (8-12 WORDS TARGET)
   - Structure: Genre, Energy/Moods, Key Instrument/Elements (optional), Time/Setting, Vibe/Atmosphere/Activity
   - Target: 8-12 words (comma-separated, can use multi-word phrases)
   - Layer your description: concrete ‚Üí energy ‚Üí optional instrument ‚Üí setting ‚Üí vibe/activity
   - Selective instruments work when descriptive (soft keys, gentle saxophone, bassline)
   - Multi-word phrases add depth: "fun day with friends", "night city street", "rainy window"

   ‚úÖ EXCELLENT EXAMPLES:
   - "Indie rock, energetic, summer, full of life, fun day with friends"
   - "Lo-fi, chill, night, soft keys, rainy window, city lights"
   - "Smooth jazz, calm, warm, gentle saxophone, quiet night, reading"
   - "Hip hop, slow beat, mellow, bassline, urban, night city street"
   - "Synthwave, energetic, 80s, neon lights, nostalgic, night drive"
   - "Pop rock, energetic, bright, summer, good vibes, friends"

   ‚ùå BAD (kitchen sink approach - too many redundant technical terms):
   "Indie rock, energetic, upbeat, summer, guitar, fast, drums, happy, melodic, bright, rhythmic, lively, clean, pop, bassline"
   (15 words - redundant energy words, too many instruments, lacks storytelling)

4. "description": FALLBACK (brief essence for backwards compatibility)
   - One sentence capturing core concept
   - Example: "Uplifting indie pop with bright guitars and energetic drums"

KEY PRINCIPLES:
1. ElevenLabs: 100-200 words, no artist names, detailed instrumental descriptions
2. Loudly: 100-200 words WITH artist/band names, detailed descriptions, optional contextual framing
3. Mubert: 8-12 words, structured storytelling: genre ‚Üí energy ‚Üí optional instrument ‚Üí setting ‚Üí vibe/activity
4. Music generators understand: instruments, tempo, playing techniques, genres
5. Music generators DON'T understand: brand associations, social contexts, experiential feelings
6. If it's not something a musician would say about the music itself, don't include it

VALIDATION CHECKLIST BEFORE SENDING:
‚úì ElevenLabs: 100-200 words, no artist names, detailed instrumental descriptions
‚úì Loudly: 100-200 words WITH artist/band names, detailed descriptions, optional contextual framing
‚úì Mubert: 8-12 words, structured storytelling with multi-word phrases, selective instruments okay
‚úì Description: One sentence essence
‚úì All: Concrete musical terms, avoid experiential language

Sound effect examples by theme (keep the description as short and concise, don't overdo it):
- Baby products: "baby giggling", "baby crying softly"
- Automotive: "car engine starting", "car door closing"
- Food/beverage: "soda can opening", "sizzling pan"
- Technology: "notification chime", "keyboard typing"

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include duration info in sound effect descriptions (e.g., don't write "2s" or "short"). Use the separate "duration" field instead.

Sound effect placement guidelines:
- Use "playAfter": "start" for INTRO sounds that set the scene (e.g., car engine starting, door opening, notification chime)
- Use "playAfter": "previous" for OUTRO sounds that follow the last voice (e.g., door closing, satisfying click)
- Intro sounds create anticipation and context BEFORE the voice speaks
- Outro sounds reinforce the message AFTER the voice finishes
- Consider: Does this sound introduce the ad (start) or conclude it (previous)?

Examples of intro (start) vs outro (previous) sounds:
- Automotive: car engine starting (start) vs car door closing (previous)
- Tech: notification arriving (start) vs keyboard confirm sound (previous)
- Food: sizzle starting (start) vs satisfying bite sound (previous)
- Retail: door chime (start) vs cash register (previous)`;
