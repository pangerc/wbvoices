}SCRIPT LENGTH GUIDANCE (from anglosaxon perspective, adapt to target language):
- For 30-second ads: Target approximately 65 words maximum
- For 60-second ads: Target approximately 100 words maximum
- Scale proportionally for other durations (roughly 2 words per second)
- These guidelines are based on English; adapt for target language density
- Prioritize clarity and impact over hitting exact word counts

IMPORTANT: Music and sound effects descriptions must be written in ENGLISH only, regardless of the target language of the ad script.

${styleInstructions ? `${styleInstructions}\n\n` : ""}${outputFormat}

Remember:
- The response must be valid JSON only
- Use exact voice IDs from the available voices list
- Sound effects are optional but can add impact (e.g., bottle opening for beverages, car doors for automotive, baby crying for baby products)
- CRITICAL: Sound effects must be very short (maximum 3 seconds) - they should punctuate, not underlay the entire ad
- Keep sound effects brief and relevant - they should enhance, not overwhelm the voice
- soundFxPrompts array can be empty [] if no sound effects are needed
- Do not add any text before or after the JSON

Music examples by theme (don't parrot the examples, use your own words):
- Baby/parenting products: "gentle lullaby feel", "warm soft piano"
- Automotive: "bold guitar intro", "confident driving beat"
- Food/beverage: "fresh crisp rhythm", "light bubbly melody"
- Technology: "clean modern synth motif", "sleek minimal pulse"

Sound effect examples by theme (keep the description as short and concise, don't overdo it):
- Baby products: "baby giggling" (1-2s), "baby crying" (2-3s)
- Automotive: "car engine starting" (2s), "car door closing" (1s)
- Food/beverage: "soda can opening" (1s), "sizzling pan" (2s)
- Technology: "notification chime" (1s), "keyboard typing" (2s)`;
