}SCRIPT LENGTH GUIDANCE (from anglosaxon perspective, adapt to target language):
- For 30-second ads: Target approximately 65 words maximum
- For 60-second ads: Target approximately 100 words maximum
- Scale proportionally for other durations (roughly 2 words per second)
- These guidelines are based on English; adapt for target language density
- Prioritize clarity and impact over hitting exact word counts

IMPORTANT: Music and sound effects descriptions must be written in ENGLISH only, regardless of the target language of the ad script.

${styleInstructions ? `${styleInstructions}\n\n` : ""}${outputFormat}

Remember:
- The response must be valid JSON only
- Use exact voice IDs from the available voices list
- Sound effects are optional but can add impact (e.g., bottle opening for beverages, car doors for automotive, baby crying for baby products)
- CRITICAL: Sound effects must be very short (maximum 3 seconds) - they should punctuate, not underlay the entire ad
- Keep sound effects brief and relevant - they should enhance, not overwhelm the voice
- soundFxPrompts array can be empty [] if no sound effects are needed
- Do not add any text before or after the JSON

MUSIC GENERATION GUIDANCE - PROVIDER-SPECIFIC PROMPTS REQUIRED:

You MUST generate FOUR optimized music prompts for different providers.
Each has specific constraints that MUST be respected:

1. "description": Base music concept (1 sentence, fallback for backwards compatibility)
2. "elevenlabs": Detailed instrumental descriptions (100-200 words)
3. "loudly": Short phrase structure (genre blend + energy + mood + tempo)
4. "mubert": Keyword structure (250 character MAXIMUM)

UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES (base guidance for detailed prompts):

Music generators are LITERAL - they understand instruments, tempo, and playing techniques.
They DON'T understand brand associations, social contexts, or experiential feelings.

Describe the MUSIC (what musicians play), not the experience of listening to it.

‚ö†Ô∏è These examples are TEMPLATES - adapt them creatively to your specific brief.
Do not copy the vocabulary or phrasing verbatim. Use them as a style guide only.

‚ùå BAD (produces generic muzak - uses abstract/experiential language):
"Bright, upbeat indie pop track with sparkling acoustic guitar strums, crisp handclaps, and light, bouncy drums. The melody is playful and sunny, evoking the feeling of a lively Spanish terrace on a warm afternoon. Uplifting bass and breezy tambourine add energy and freshness, perfect for youthful gatherings and spontaneous moments. The music is cheerful and dynamic, creating a sense of fun, friendship, and effortless cool, matching the Coca-Cola vibe."
^ Problems: "evoking the feeling", "Spanish terrace", "youthful gatherings", "fun, friendship, effortless cool", "Coca-Cola vibe" - music generators don't understand these!

‚úÖ GOOD BASE EXAMPLE (detailed instrumental approach - works for ElevenLabs):
"Uplifting indie pop song with bright, jangly electric guitars, fast rhythmic strumming, light bouncy drums. Catchy summery vibe, energetic but laid-back, with tambourine accents and walking bassline."
‚Üí Detailed (100-200 words), instrumental descriptions, concrete musical terms

---

PROVIDER-SPECIFIC TRANSFORMATIONS:

Starting from the base concept above, transform it for each provider:

1. "elevenlabs": USE DETAILED INSTRUMENTAL APPROACH DIRECTLY
   - 100-200 words with concrete musical descriptions
   - NO artist/band names (only constraint)
   - Focus on: instruments, tempo, playing techniques, genres
   - Avoid: brand associations, social contexts, experiential feelings

   Example: "Uplifting indie pop song with bright, jangly electric guitars, fast rhythmic strumming, light bouncy drums. Catchy summery vibe, energetic but laid-back, with tambourine accents and walking bassline."

2. "loudly": CONDENSE TO SHORT PHRASE STRUCTURE
   - Format: [genre blend] [energy level] [mood] [tempo]
   - Can blend 2 genres maximum
   - Energy types: high, low, original
   - Add "fast" or "slow" for tempo
   - Mood vocabulary: energetic, uplifting, happy, chill, relaxing, dark, moody, inspirational, dramatic, playful, tense, calm, aggressive, melancholic, hopeful, mysterious, romantic, funky, groovy, sad
   - Band references optional but not required
   - Keep it short and concise

   Example from base: "Indie rock and indie pop blend, high energy, uplifting, fast"

3. "mubert": CONDENSE TO KEYWORD STRUCTURE (250 CHAR MAXIMUM)
   - Format: [genre] [mood] [activity] [optional instruments] [optional BPM]
   - Use ONE WORD per element
   - Moods must align with genre
   - Band names rarely work - AVOID
   - Shorter = better results
   - Instruments are optional (don't always work well)
   - COUNT CHARACTERS - must be ‚â§250

   Example from base: "Indie rock energetic summer guitar drums upbeat"
   Character count: 51 - well under 250 limit

4. "description": FALLBACK (brief essence for backwards compatibility)
   - One sentence capturing core concept
   - Example: "Uplifting indie pop with bright guitars and energetic drums"

KEY PRINCIPLES:
1. ElevenLabs: 100-200 words, no artist names, detailed instrumental descriptions
2. Loudly: Short phrase with genre blend + energy + mood + tempo structure
3. Mubert: Keyword structure, one word per element, MUST be ‚â§250 characters
4. Music generators understand: instruments, tempo, playing techniques, genres
5. Music generators DON'T understand: brand associations, social contexts, experiential feelings
6. If it's not something a musician would say about the music itself, don't include it

VALIDATION CHECKLIST BEFORE SENDING:
‚úì ElevenLabs: 100-200 words, no artist names, detailed instrumental descriptions
‚úì Loudly: Short phrase with genre blend + energy + mood + tempo structure
‚úì Mubert: Keyword structure, count characters - MUST be ‚â§250
‚úì Description: One sentence essence
‚úì All: Concrete musical terms, avoid experiential language

Sound effect examples by theme (keep the description as short and concise, don't overdo it):
- Baby products: "baby giggling", "baby crying softly"
- Automotive: "car engine starting", "car door closing"
- Food/beverage: "soda can opening", "sizzling pan"
- Technology: "notification chime", "keyboard typing"

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include duration info in sound effect descriptions (e.g., don't write "2s" or "short"). Use the separate "duration" field instead.

Sound effect placement guidelines:
- Use "playAfter": "start" for INTRO sounds that set the scene (e.g., car engine starting, door opening, notification chime)
- Use "playAfter": "previous" for OUTRO sounds that follow the last voice (e.g., door closing, satisfying click)
- Intro sounds create anticipation and context BEFORE the voice speaks
- Outro sounds reinforce the message AFTER the voice finishes
- Consider: Does this sound introduce the ad (start) or conclude it (previous)?

Examples of intro (start) vs outro (previous) sounds:
- Automotive: car engine starting (start) vs car door closing (previous)
- Tech: notification arriving (start) vs keyboard confirm sound (previous)
- Food: sizzle starting (start) vs satisfying bite sound (previous)
- Retail: door chime (start) vs cash register (previous)`;
