# 2026 Video Generation Roadmap

_January 2025_

## Executive Summary

Evolution of Aleph's voice ad platform into video generation with two tracks:

1. **Veo3/Bytedance Branded Video** (Q1-Q2 lead): Immersive product placement for enterprise clients
2. **Synthesia Avatar Ads** (Q3-Q4 follow): Dialogue and personality-focused ad reads

**Strategic Choice**: Branded video first delivers maximum enterprise value (automotive, luxury, FMCG). Avatar capabilities layer on proven video infrastructure in H2.

**Team**: 2 people (senior dev + researcher/support)

**Outcome**: By Q4 2026, dual video capabilities (branded + avatar) serving 20+ clients with 50+ campaigns.

## Why Veo3 First, Synthesia Second?

**Veo3/Bytedance First**:
- Product placement = higher enterprise client value
- Bigger market differentiation (avatars are commoditizing)
- Infrastructure built here makes Synthesia easier later

**Synthesia Second**:
- Lower integration risk (mature API)
- Complementary use cases (pharma disclaimers, testimonials)
- Reuses video pipeline from Q1-Q2

---

## Quarterly Roadmap

### Q1 2026: Veo3 Foundation

**Veo3/Bytedance Track**:
- Partnership negotiation + API access (Veo3, Bytedance, or Runway backup)
- Brand asset management system (logos, products, colors)
- Prompt engineering by vertical (automotive, luxury, FMCG)
- 30+ test videos validating product placement quality

**Platform Track**:
- Legal framework (EU AI Act compliance, deepfake disclosure)
- Video storage infrastructure (Vercel Blob scaling, 10-100x audio)
- VideoProvider abstraction (extend Strategy Pattern)

**Deliverables**: Legal approved + brand system working + 30 test videos

---

### Q2 2026: Veo3 Production Pipeline

**Veo3/Bytedance Track**:

## Success Gates

| Quarter | Gate | Metrics |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Q1** | Foundation Ready | Legal approved, brand system working, 30 test videos |
| **Q2** | Pipeline Operational | Audio-video sync working, 10 internal campaigns |
| **Q3** | Dual Capability | 3+ clients using Veo3, Synthesia integrated, 15 campaigns |
| **Q4** | Market Ready | 20+ clients, 50+ campaigns, <5% error rate, positive ROI |

---

## Team Allocation

**Person 1 (Senior Dev)**:
- Q1: Brand asset system + architecture
- Q2: Veo3 integration + audio-video sync
- Q3: Synthesia integration + unified abstraction
- Q4: Advanced features + production hardening

**Person 2 (Researcher/Support)**:
- Q1: Partnership negotiation + legal research
- Q2: Internal testing + asset curation
- Q3: Client beta coordination + feedback
- Q4: Onboarding + documentation + support

## Budget Estimates (2026)

| Category | Annual Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| API Costs | $5-10K | 100-200 videos/month testing + production |
| Storage/CDN | $3-5K | Video is 10-100x larger than audio |
| Legal Review | $2-3K | Framework + quarterly compliance |
| Tools | $1-2K | FFmpeg, video processing |
| Subscriptions | $3-5K | Synthesia, backup providers |
| **Total** | **$14-25K** | **~$1.2-2.1K/month** |

---

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Veo3 access delays | Medium | High | Runway ML backup, Bytedance alternative |
| Brand asset quality | High | Medium | Preprocessing pipeline, manual QA gates |
| Storage cost explosion | High | Medium | Aggressive caching, preview quality tiers |
| Legal compliance | Low | Critical | Over-label content, legal review all templates |
| Avatar uncanny valley | Medium | High | Careful selection, HeyGen backup |
| Team bandwidth | High | High | Strict MVP scope, outsource non-core |

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Extend Strategy Pattern for Video

```typescript
abstract class BaseVideoProvider extends BaseAudioProvider {
  abstract generateBrandedVideo(config: VideoConfig): Promise<VideoResult>;
  abstract generateAvatar(config: AvatarConfig): Promise<VideoResult>;
  abstract getProgress(taskId: string): Promise<ProgressResult>;
}

class GoogleVeoVideoProvider extends BaseVideoProvider { /* ... */ }
class SynthesiaVideoProvider extends BaseVideoProvider { /* ... */ }
```

**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with audio provider pattern, easy to add new providers.

### 2. Reuse Audio Pipeline

Generate audio via existing ElevenLabs/OpenAI → sync with video.

**Rationale**: No duplication, maintains quality, preserves customization (emotional tags, speed).

### 3. Client Preview, Server Final

Browser for fast previews, server (FFmpeg) for production quality.

**Rationale**: Fast iteration + professional output + cost management.

### 4. Legal First

Compliance runs from Q1, not bolted on later.

**Rationale**: EU AI Act already in force, enterprise clients demand it, better safe than sorry.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Brand Asset Quality**
- Solution: Preprocessing pipeline (background removal, format conversion, resolution checks)

**Challenge 2: Audio-Video Timing**
- Solution: Duration constraints in prompts, post-generation speed adjustments, manual override tools

**Challenge 3: Cost Management**
- Solution: Preview quality defaults ($0.40), production requires approval ($2.00), aggressive caching

**Challenge 4: API Instability**
- Solution: Backup providers (Runway, HeyGen), provider abstraction enables easy swapping

---

## Integration with Existing System

**Voice Generation** (unchanged):
- ElevenLabs V3 for quality, OpenAI for speed
- Strategy Pattern prompts remain primary system
- Video adds on top, doesn't replace

**Mixer Timeline** (extended):
- Add video track type alongside audio tracks
- Video preview thumbnails + scrubbing
- Volume controls for video audio layer

**Storage** (scaled 10-100x):
- Vercel Blob: 100 GB → 1 TB (estimate)
- CloudFlare CDN for global delivery
- Auto-delete policies (7/30 days)

---

## 2027+ Future Considerations

**Potential Enhancements**:
- Interactive video ads (click-to-explore)
- Vertical format (Instagram/TikTok 9:16)
- Real-time brand monitoring (CV compliance checks)
- Industry templates (15+ verticals)
- A/B testing variants (auto-generate 2-3 versions)

**Next Architecture Step**:
- Full provider standardization (audio, video, music unified pattern)
- 90% code reduction for new providers (200 lines → 20 lines)

---

## Key Takeaways

**Strategic Positioning**:
- Differentiation: Full video generation with brand integration (not just avatars)
- Enterprise focus: Product placement for premium clients
- Lean team: 2 people leveraging existing architecture
- Compliance first: Legal from Q1, not afterthought

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Q1: Legal + brand system + 30 test videos
- Q2: Working pipeline + 10 internal campaigns
- Q3: Enterprise beta + Synthesia live + 15 campaigns
- Q4: 20+ clients, 50+ campaigns, positive ROI

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Hybrid audio-video platform (not just audio like WellSaid, not just avatars like Synthesia)
- Enterprise quality + compliance + brand integration
- Lean operations + provider abstractions = fast iteration
